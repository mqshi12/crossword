# crossword

Hi, thanks for checking out my project!
You can run the crossword generator with your own templates by modifying the code in /python/crossword.py - you can also modify the dictionary.json and names.json, or add new JSON files, to add your own hints or change mine

You can run the website (or modify it!) by running npm install and then npm run dev in /website
